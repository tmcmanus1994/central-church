/**
 * The current week's bulletin, parsed from the weekly PDF.
 *
 * The printed bulletin is the church's source of truth: it carries events the
 * calendar misses, real names for entries the calendar abbreviates, and the
 * standing information (classes, ongoing ministries, order of worship) that
 * never appears on a calendar at all. Everything here comes from that PDF and
 * the Friday newsletter.
 *
 * `node scripts/import-bulletin.mjs <pdf>` parses a new bulletin into a draft
 * under `content-drafts/`, listing what changed and what needs a human read.
 * The curated copy below is then updated from it — the script never
 * overwrites this file, because bulletin shorthand ("30's potluck", "Chili
 * and Pushups") needs rewriting before it's public-facing.
 *
 * Both /bulletin and /hub read from here, so the two never drift apart.
